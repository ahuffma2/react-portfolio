        "I guided this team on making a website from scratch using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, along with Marvel API and Google Books API. While most of the code wasn't directly mine, I had a hand in almost all of it. I created all documentation, kanban boards, Managed the Git repo, resident question answerer. I learned a lot about what it takes to manage a team. You need concrete coding standard. You need documentation and ensure that each of your members is adhering to documentation. All preformed in a single Agile Sprint in a week.",

        "This project was a huge endeavor with me being the lead programmer and having a hand in every single system we created. I learned about Git and version control which, hoo-boy, with students is a task and a half. The meat and potatoes for this game however was my, custom OpenGL shader programming, Animation Rigging and Animation State Management programming, Character Controllers, Level Design, 3D Character Modelling, and AI. Many of these systems I learned and improved on as we progressed. We also did weekly sprints following an Agile Methodology, adhering to the core principles.",
